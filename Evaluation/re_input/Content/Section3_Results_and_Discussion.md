The PBPK model for inulin was evaluated with plasma and tissue PK data from rats.

The next sections show:

1. the final model parameters for the building blocks: [Section 3.1](#final-input-parameters).
2. the overall goodness of fit: [Section 3.2](#diagnostics-plots).
3. simulated vs. observed concentration-time profiles for the clinical studies used for model building and for model verification: [Section 3.3](#ct-profiles).
