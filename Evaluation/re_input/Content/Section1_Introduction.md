Inulin is a highly hydrophilic polysaccharide which does not distribute into cells and is cleared via glomerular filtration. 

Inulin has a considerably smaller solute radius than the proteins which had been used to develop the generic large molecule physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model in PK-Sim ([Niederalt 2018](#5-references)).   

The herein presented evaluation report evaluates the performance of the PBPK model for inulin in rats using the large molecule model in PK-Sim.

The presented inulin PBPK model as well as the respective evaluation plan and evaluation report are provided open-source (https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Inulin-Model).
